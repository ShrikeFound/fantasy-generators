  however many followers they can gather.`,

  with subordinate clergy obedient to their own
  pontiff and perhaps cooperative with others.`,
  `There is a single pontiff with a layer of upper
  clergy and temple heads beneath them, who
  have a layer of minor clergy serving them.`,
  `Individual congregations are independent, with
  their clergy subject to the consensus will of their
  parishoners.`,
  `Powerful lay believers fund temples that are
  subject to their familyâ€™s wishes, staffed by clergy
  supported by their funding.`,
  `There is no official clergy; some believers may
  take up special roles or provide teaching, but
  they are not qualitatively different from others.`,
  `The church is entirely part of the secular structure
  of the land, its clergy no more than officials
  appointed by the government to their roles.
